# Hai!
### I'm Coopydood. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

### :wave: About Me
I'm a full time student who likes *computers, gaming, dirtbikes, and even trains*. I specialise in graphic design and video production. I code some stuff on here now n' again.

### :man_technologist: My Projects
Based on my n00b level of knowledge on languages like *Python, C#, and HTML*, I've created a couple things on here. Feel free to have a nosy!

My current active project is **ultimate-macOS-KVM**, which provides an easy / automated way into KVM and PCI passthrough.

#### :scotland:     Oh and I'm from the tiny country of Scotland :]
