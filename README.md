<h3>About Me</h3>

I'm a full time student who likes *computers, gaming, dirtbikes, and even trains*. I specialise in graphic design and video production. I code some stuff on here now n' again.

Based on my n00b level of knowledge on languages like *Python, C#, and HTML*, I've created a couple things on here. Feel free to have a nosy!

My current active project is **[ultimate-macOS-KVM](https://github.com/Coopydood/ultimate-macOS-KVM)**, which provides an easy / automated way into KVM and PCI passthrough. I'm still a designer at heart, though - I also made a fluent GRUB theme called **[HyperFluent](https://github.com/Coopydood/HyperFluent-GRUB-Theme)**.
